**What is SQANTI for?**

SQANTI (Structural and Quality Annotation of Novel Transcript Isoforms) is a pipeline created for the characterization of isoforms obtained by full-length transcript sequencing, which are commonly returned in a fasta file format without any extra information about gene/transcript annotation or attribute description.

Although thought to be used for characterization of isoforms generated by long-read sequencing, SQANTI can be used for any set of transcript isoforms in fasta file format.

As long-read sequencing have a high error rate of errors, SQANTI first performs a reference-based correction of sequences. Secondly, generates genes models and computes a ORF prediction for each isoform, obtaining information about the coding potential of each defined isoform. Finally it carries out a deep characterization of isoforms at both transcript and junction level and generates a report with several plots describing in detail the mayor attributes that catalog your set of sequenced-isoforms.





 (it also can be used to characterize any set of transcripts)


 reference-based corrected transcriptome, a transcript-level annotation file containing several expression, structural and quality features, and a set of different summary descriptive plots for the entire dataset 

the predicted ORF sequences for PacBio sequences and two annotation files. The first one at transcript-level annotation and containing â€¦orf predicted informantion, gene characterization, etc, and the second one at junction-level.
