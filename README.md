##**Summary**##

SQANTI is a pipeline for the in-depth characterization of isoforms obtained by full-length transcript sequencing, which are commonly returned in a fasta file format without any extra information about gene/transcript annotation or attribute description. SQANTI provides a wide range of descriptors of transcript quality and generates a graphical report to aid in the interpretation of the sequencing results.

Although SQANTI is oriented to be used for characterization of isoforms generated by PacBio Iso-Seq pipeline, it can be used for any set of transcript isoforms in fasta file format. Besides, it can be applied to any organism.

Moreover, SQANTI adds another functionality, SQANTI filtering function, that allows to filter out artifact transcripts by taking advantage of SQANTI-provided attributes and Machine Learning methods.

SQANTI pipeline steps:

1. First, as long-read sequencing usually has a high rate of errors along sequences, it performs a **reference-based correction of sequences**.

2. Secondly, it **generates genes models** and **classifies transcripts based on splice junctions**.

3. Third, it **predicts ORFs** for each transcript, obtaining information about the coding potential of each sequence. 

4. Finally, it carries out a **deep characterization of isoforms at both transcript and junction level** and **generates a report** with several plots describing in detail the mayor attributes that catalog your set of sequenced isoforms.

5. Together with SQANTI_qc function, the user can use the **SQANTI filter function to remove isoforms potential to be artifacts**. To get this curanted transcriptome, SQANTI filtering uses machine learning methods together with SQANTI_qc attributes to create a classifier of artifacts.

## **Running** ##

SQANTI is a program written in python. It is divided into two functions:

* **Sqanti_qc.py**, performing the in-depth characterization of transcripts
* **Sqanti_filter.py**, applying matching learning methods to filter transcripts that are likely to be artifacts.

Below you can see the help page of SQANTI functions where their mandatory and optional arguments are explained.

## Mandatory Input Files: ##

**1. Isoforms:** Isoforms to characterize must be given in a fasta file format. The accepted formats for the fasta headers are:

>\>PB.3.1|chr1:4857776-4897906(+)|i1_c1034/f143p70/2586 

where "PB.3.1" is taken as the isoform ID (typical format returned by PacBio sequencing).

>\>gi|737676268|ref|NM_001545.2| Description 

where NM_001545.2 is taken as the isoform ID (typical format for RefSeq entries).

> \>ENST00000434970.2 cdna chromosome:GRCh38:7:142786213:142786224:1 gene:ENSG00000282431.1 

where ENST00000434970.2 is taken as the isoform ID (typical format for Ensembl entries).

You can also provide Isoforms in gtf file format specifying -g option. "transcript_id" and "gene_id" attributes are mandatory inside GTF file.

# 
**2. Annotation:** To create gene models and therefore annotate each isoform to the corresponding reference gene and reference transcript it's mandatory to provide a reference annotation file in GTF format (http://www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html). "transcript_id" and "gene_id" attributes are mandatory for each defined isoform.

# 
**3. Genome:** It must be given in a unique fasta file. "fai" index file must be located in same folder as the fasta file.


#
##Optional Input Files:##

#
**1. Expression Matrix:** Isoform expression. The format must be a tabulated file where the first column corresponds to the isoform identifiers. Next columns must represent the expression levels for each studied sample. The header must have a label for each studied sample.
Expression values can be computed with any software design to calculate transcript expression. We recommend to use short-reads sequencing followed by programs as RSEM, Kallisto or eXpress which allow to calculate accurately isoform expression. 

#
**2. Coverage:** Short-read coverage across junctions represents an informative measure for quality control of sequenced transcripts. STAR aligner output files are the required format files of SQANTI. More specifically, "SJ.out.tab" are the required ones ([STAR manual](http://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gingeraslab/www-data/dobin/STAR/STAR.posix/doc/STARmanual.pdf)). To get them, short-read data must be align by using STAR aligner. Each sample must be run separately. 

#
**3. FL_count:** As SQANTI was developed for the annotation and quality control of IsoSeq PacBio isoforms, you can provide PacBio abundance files where the number of Full-length reads associated to each PacBio-defined isoform is stored. Specifically, SQANTI uses the "*.abundance.txt" files.

#
**4. Gmap indexes:** Pre-computed genome indexes for GMAP aligner must be provided. 

#

**Note: You can check format of input files in "example_dataset" folder which contains an example.**


##Output Files:##

**1. *name*_corrected.fasta:** Transcript sequences after correction using genome sequence.

**2. *name*_corrected.gff**, **name_corrected.gtf** and **name_corrected.sam**: Alignment of corrected sequences 

**3. *name*.faa:** File with predicted ORF sequences for corrected isoforms. GeneMarkS-T (http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/) was used to predict coding sequences in eukaryotic transcripts. Also a GMST folder is created with extra information returned by GMST.

**4. RTS folder:** Folder which stores a file with information about junctions that are potential to have suffered RT-switching during retrotranscription. RT switching algorithm locates 8 nt direct repeats characteristic of RT switching between the upstream mRNA boundary of the non-canonical intron and the intron region adjacent to the downstream exon boundary with a slide of 1 nucleotide upstream/downstream. FSM transcripts with the highest mean expression in each gene are assumed to serve as templates for RT switching and are excluded from the analysis.

**5. *name*_classification.txt:** File with attribute information at isoform level (table explaining features at the bottom of the file)

**6. *name*_junctions.txt:** File with attribute information at splice junction level.

**7. *name*_report.pdf:** PDF file showing different quality control and descriptive plots.
